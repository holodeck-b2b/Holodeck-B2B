    <name>Holodeck B2B - Default Security</name>
    <description>This project contains the default implementations of the Holodeck B2B Security Provider and Certificate Manager. 
        Because the Security Provider and Certificate Manager are separate and lousely coupled components in the Holodeck B2B, they
        are included in two separate modules. Do however note that the included Security Provider is tightly integrated with the
        Certificate Manager and cannot be deployed with a different one. The Certificate Manager however can be used with other
        Security Providers.</description>
