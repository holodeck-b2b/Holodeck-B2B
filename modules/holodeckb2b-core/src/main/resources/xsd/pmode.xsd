        <xs:documentation><p>The ebMS specification only defines an abstract P-Mode model, the actual P-Mode definition is left up to implementations. This schema defines the XML structure for the representation of a P-Mode as used by the default implementation for maintaining the P-Mode set. In this implementation the P-Mode set consists of all XML documents in a directory. Each XML document represents one P-Mode and must conform to this schema. See the package <code>org.holodeckb2b.pmode.xml</code> for more info on the default implementation of P-Modes.</p></xs:documentation>
        <xs:documentation><p>In version 2.1.0 of the schema the <code>EventHandler</code> and <code>AddActorOrRoleAttribute</code> elements were added. As these are optional elements P-Mode documents constructed using the old version are still valid and result in unchanged processing. Therefore the same namespace is used and only the version has been increased</p></xs:documentation>
        <xs:documentation><p>In version 4.0.0 of the schema the optional <code>PMode/useStrictHeaderValidation</code> attribute was added. It can be use to enable strict validation of the ebMS header</p></xs:documentation>
        <xs:documentation><p>In version 4.0.0 of the schema the structure of the <code>ReceptionAwareness</code> element was changed to enable more flexible configuration of retries. For back-ward compatibility the old fixed intervals can also be used although there use
            is NOT RECOMMENDED.</p></xs:documentation>
        <xs:documentation><p>In version 5.0.0 of the schema the cardina;ity for Leg has been changed to 1..2 to support Two-Way P-Modes. Also the default values for the key transport algorithms were updated to RSA-OAEP and MGF1 with SHA256</p></xs:documentation>

    <xs:element name="PMode" type="tns:PMode">
        <xs:annotation>
            <xs:documentation><p>The P-Mode as defined in this schema is based on the structure described in appendix D of the Core Specification. As described in section D.2 one leg may involve two sets of P-Mode parameters if pulling is used as the pull request signal has its own set of parameters. This is reflected in this model by the <i>flow</i> concept. When a leg uses the pull binding it has two flows, one for the pull request and one for the user message.</p>

<p>The P-Mode parameters are used to set values in the ebMS message header and determine how and where to send messages. All parameter values must be known when the message is sent, but it is not necessary to include them all in the P-Mode. This would require a P-Mode for each exchanged message while some messages only differ on specific configuration parameters. Therefor Holodeck B2B allows the P-Mode to define only the common parameters and supply the message specific ones when the message is submitted. It is RECOMMENDED to include at least the initiator or responder of the exchange and information about the user message.
<br/>Security settings however can <b>only be specified in the P-Mode</b>. So if security must be applied to the messages governed by this P-Mode the configuration must be included in the Initiator and or Responder elements.</p></xs:documentation>

When this attribute has value <i>"false"</i> (default value) the P-Mode id will not be included in the message header or used to find the P-Mode when a message is received.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: As the P-Mode id is included in the message as part of the agreement reference, including the P-Mode id requires the specification of an agreement reference either in the P-Mode or when the message is submitted.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: If set to <i>"false"</i> the P-Mode id included in a received message will not be used to determine the P-Mode that handles the message. This is to prevent an unintended match on the identifier set by a sender.</p></xs:documentation>

In the P-Mode model described in the ebMS specification a leg can be identified by number (1 or 2) or label (<i>request</i> or <i>reply</i>).

<p>The parameters for Receipt are defined in appendix D of the Core Specification as part of the P-Mode parameter group <b>Security</b>. As they are not directly related to security settings we moved them to a separate <i>"Receipt"</i> group and this element.<br/>
The ebMS specification defines the <b>PMode[1].Security.SendReceipt</b> parameter that indicate whether a Receipt should be sent for a user message.

<p>By including the certificate path or chain in the binary security token the receiver of message does not need to know the end entity's certificate but can rely on the trust from a certificate authority. This makes certificate management much simpler as only the CA certificates need to be known on the receiving MSH.</p>

<p>Because the certificate path can only be included in a binary security token, this option can only be used when the <code>KeyReferenceMethod</code> is set to <i>BSTReference</i>.</p>

<p>Note that the receiving MSH must also be configured to accept <b>and use</b> a certificate path for validation of the signature. Therefore the default is to only include the end-entity certificate in the WS-Security header.</p>

<p>NOTE: The certificate loaded in the keystore MUST and referenced in <code>KeystoreAlias</code> already contain the complete certificate path, Holodeck B2B will not try to construct the path based on the end-entity certificate!</p></xs:documentation>
