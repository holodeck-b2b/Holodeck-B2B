/**
 * Is the JPA entity class that represent a state during the processing of a message unit. A state consists of a name, 
 * the timestamp when the state was entered/started and a sequence number that defines the order of the processing 
 * states. The sequence number is needed because the timestamp may not be fine grained enough to guarantee correct
 * ordering of states. 
 * <p>A {@link MessageUnit} can be associated with several states, but can have only one <i>current</i> state. This is 
 * the <code>ProcessingState</code> with the highest <i>sequence number</i>. 
 * <p>Process flows and related states are not modeled in Holodeck B2B but coded into the handlers that execute the 
 * process.
