/**
 * Defines the interface of the <i>"message deliverer"</i> that is used by the Holodeck B2B core to deliver areceived 
 * message unit to the business application. 
 * <p>It is the responsibility of the <i>message deliverer</i> to correctly deliver the message unit to the business 
 * application. Holodeck B2B has no knowledge of the protocol being used to communicate with the business application.
 * The assumption is that that a successful execution of the {@link #deliver(org.holodeckb2b.common.messagemodel.IMessageUnit)} 
 * method means that the message unit is successfully delivered to the business application. 
 * <p>This decoupling of internal and external interface makes it easy to implement different protocols for message 
 * delivery. Each protocol probably has its own set of configuration parameters and optimal connection usage. Therefor
 * Holodeck B2B uses a factory class to get instances of a pre-configured deliverer. 
 * <p>This means that implementing a <i>delivery method</i> requires two classes, one implementing this 
 * interface to do the actual delivery of the messages and one implementing {@link IMessageDelivererFactory} that will
 * create the pre-configured deliverers.
 * <p>Which <i>delivery method</i> and with which settings should be used for a message unit is configured in the P-Mode.
