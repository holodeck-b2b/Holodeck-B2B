/**
 * Defines the interface for an event that (can) occur during message processing. These <i>message processing events</i>
 * should be used to provide additional information to the business application about the processing of a message unit.
 * For example to inform the application that a message unit has been (re)sent. 
 * <p>Event are generally triggered by components of the Holodeck B2B Core (see package {@link 
 * org.holodeckb2b.interfaces.events.types} for overview of events) but handled by extensions to report them to
 * the external applications. These extension should implement the {@link IMessageProcessingEventHandler} interface. The 
 * P-Mode is used to configure the handlers as events may be only of interest for certain messages and applications.
 * <p>This interface is very generic and only defines the relation to the <i>message unit</i> to which the event applies 
 * and some general meta-data like an identifier, timestamp and optional short description of the event. There is no 
 * method defined to get the type of event as each type of event should have its own implementing class or extension of 
 * this interface.
