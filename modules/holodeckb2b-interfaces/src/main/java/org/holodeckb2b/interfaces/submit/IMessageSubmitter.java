/**
 * Describes the interface the Holodeck B2B Core exposes to create a new ebMS User Message message unit for sending.
 * <p>Note that this is more or less an internal interface intended for use by helper classes that handle the submission 
 * of business data from the client application (called the <i>Producer</i> in the ebMS V3 Specification).<br> 
 * By decoupling the internal and external interface it is easier to implement different protocols for accepting 
 * messages from the client applications without these "acceptors" needing to know about the Holodeck B2B internals.
