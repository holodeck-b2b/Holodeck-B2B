/**
 * Describes the general P-Mode parameters for processing receipt signals. 
 * <p>The ebMS V3 Core Specification does not specify in detail when and how receipt signals should be used. It only 
 * specifies P-Mode parameters for whether the receipt should be send, the reply pattern to use and the address where 
 * to sent the receipts to if to sent as a response. 
 * <p>These parameters are defined in appendix D of the Core Specification as part of the P-Mode parameter group 
 * <b>Security</b>. As they are not directly related to security settings we moved them to a separate <i>"Receipt"</i> 
 * group.<br> 
 * The ebMS specification defines the <b>PMode[1].Security.SendReceipt</b> parameter that indicate whether a Receipt
 * should be sent for a user message. This parameter is not directly implemented in Holodeck B2B but its value derived
 * from the existence of a receipt configuration for a leg, i.e. <b>PMode[1].Security.Receipt</b> := 
 * <code>{@link ILeg#getReceiptConfiguration()} != null</code>.
 * <p>The content of the signal are not strictly defined and are left open for further specification in profiles (like 
 * AS4). Currently Holodeck B2B will always generate a receipt signal as specified in the AS4 profile (see section 5.1.8
 * of the profile). Future version of this interface may introduce the option to specify the <i>"receipt content 
 * generator"</i>.
