 * Is used to specify how a message unit should be delivered to the business application.

 * {@link IMessageDeliverer}s. The delivery specification tells Holodeck B2B how to construct the correct deliverer.
 * <p>The delivery specification consists of the {@link IMessageDelivererFactory} that should be used to create the
 * actual {@link IMessageDeliverer} and the settings needed to configure them. 
 * <p>The delivery specification is part of the P-Mode that governs the message exchange.For each delivery specification 
 * Holodeck B2B will create a factory with the given settings. To allow reuse of a delivery method instance (i.e. a 
 * configured delivered method) the [optional] id of a delivery specification will be used by Holodeck B2B to determine 
 * if it can reuse an existing factory.
