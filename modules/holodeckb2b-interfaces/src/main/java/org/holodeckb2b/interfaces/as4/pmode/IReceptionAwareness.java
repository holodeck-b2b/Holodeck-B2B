/**
 * Represents P-Mode parameters related to the <i>AS4 Reception Awareness feature</i>. This feature is a (simple)
 * reliability protocol that uses ebMS Receipt signals for acknowledgments. See section 3.2 of the AS4 profile for more
 * information.
 * <p>The AS4 profile defines five additional P-Mode parameters for the reception awareness feature. Holodeck B2B uses
 * only three parameters as some of the P-Mode parameters from the spec are combined:<ol>
 * <li><b>Maximum number of retries</b> : Indicates how many times a message should be resende if no Receipt is 
 * received. Setting this value to zero disables the retry functionality;</li>
 * <li><b>Interval before resend</b> : The time to wait for a Receipt and before a message is resend;</li>
 * <li><b>Use duplicate elimination</b> : Indication whether a message that is received twice should be delivered to the
 * business application or not. If enabled Holodeck B2B will search all received messages in database to check if the
 * message was received (and delivered) before. There is no further parameterization.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Enabling the Reception Awareness feature itself is done by including an object of this type on the leg, i.e. when
 * {@link IAS4Leg#getReceptionAwareness()} returns a non-null value. Note that we use a special type of leg ({@link 
 * IAS4Leg}) to indicate that the leg includes AS4 specific features.
