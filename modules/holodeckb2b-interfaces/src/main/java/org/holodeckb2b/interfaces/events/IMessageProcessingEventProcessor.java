 * message unit it MUST use the event processor to <i>"raise"</i> the event. The event processor will then ensure that
 * the event is handled as configured in the P-Mode that governs the processing of the message unit. To get access to
 * the running event processor use the {@link HolodeckB2BCoreInterface#getEventProcessor()} method.
