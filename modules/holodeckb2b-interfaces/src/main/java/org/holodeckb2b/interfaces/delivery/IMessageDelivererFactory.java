/**
 * Defines the interface for factoring pre-configured {@link IMessageDeliverer} implementations.   
 * <p>Message delivery to the business application is not done by the Holodeck B2B core but left to special <i>message 
 * deliverers</i>. This makes it possible to support different protocols by adding new deliverers. To allow for 
 * optimization of resources Holodeck B2B uses a factory to create the deliverers. 
 * <p>Because the delivery may need some configuration the factory is initialized with a set of parameters before 
 * deliverers are requested. The parameters to use for an actual delivery are specified by an {@link IDeliverySpecification}
 * which should be configured in the P-Mode of the message unit to be delivered. As the factory is specific for each
 * set of parameters Holodeck B2B will create a factory per {@link IDeliverySpecification}.
