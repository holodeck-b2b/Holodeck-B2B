 * Defines the configuration of a WSS UsernameToken contained in the security header of the ebMS message. Depending on
 * the direction (incoming or outgoing) of the message the information is used to set or validate the UsernameToken in

 * <p>As specified in section 7 of the Core Specification there can exist two <code>wsse:UsernameToken</code> elements
 * in the SOAP header, one targeted at the "default" actor/role and one at a specific "ebms" actor/role. The latter
 * can be used for message authorization (see section 7.10 and 7.11). Which element an instance of this interface 
 * configures is determined by the parent class. 
 * <p>Depending on the target (default or ebms) this interface corresponds with the P-Mode parameter groups 
 * <b>PMode.[Initiator|Responder].Authorization</b> ("ebms") or <b>PMode[1].Security.UsernameToken</b> (default).
