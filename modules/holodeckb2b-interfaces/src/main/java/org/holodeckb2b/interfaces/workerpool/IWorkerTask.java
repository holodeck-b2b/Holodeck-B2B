/**
 * Is an interface defining a task to be executed by a worker in a {@link WorkerPool}.  
 * <p>Tasks implement the functionality that should be executed by a worker. They do not need to manage the execution
 * itself. This is done by the {@link WorkerPool}. By separating thread management and task functionality the worker 
 * task only needs to focus on the task on hand.
 * <p><b>NOTES:</b><ul>
 * <li>Implementations MUST handle interrupts correctly and SHOULD stop processing as soon as possible when an interrupt is received.</li>
 * <li>Implementations SHOULD be thread safe as the task can be run in parallel!</li>
 * <li>When the task should executed more than once implementations SHOULD prevent unhandled exceptions to occur in the
 * {@link #run()} method as these will stop the thread and prevent repeated executing!</li>
 * </ul>
