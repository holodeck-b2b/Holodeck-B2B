/**
 * Represents a P-Mode that governs the exchange of messages. 
 * <p>The P-Mode concept is described in the chapter 4 and appendix D of the ebMS v3 Core Specification. The P-Mode 
 * contains the settings needed to successfully exchange message with another MSH. The specification only defines an
 * abstract model for the parameters, the actual P-Mode definition is left up to implementations. This interface defines
 * the structure of the Holodeck B2B P-Modes. 
 * <p>This interfaces model is based on the structure described in appendix D of the Core Specification. As described
 * in section D.2 one leg may involve two sets of P-Mode parameters if pulling is used as the pull request signal has
 * its own set of parameters. This is reflected in this model by the <i>flow</i> concept. When a leg uses the pull
 * binding it has two flows, one for the pull request and one for the user message.
 * <p>The P-Mode parameters are used to set values in the ebMS message header and determine how and where to send 
 * messages. All parameter values must be known when the message is sent, but it is not necessary to include them all
 * in the P-Mode. This would require a P-Mode for each exchanged message while some message only differ on some 
 * configuration parameters. Therefor Holodeck B2B allows the P-Mode to define only the common parameters and supply the
 * message specific ones when the message is submitted.
 * <p><b>NOTE 1: </b>Although the P-Mode model used here does support Two-Way MEP bindings, Holodeck B2B currently only
 * supports One-Way MEP bindings (support for One-Way bindings allows for full support of the AS4 profile).
 * <p><b>NOTE 2: </b>The current version does not contain all P-Mode parameters described by the Core Specification and
 * AS4 profile. When new functionality is implemented parameters will be added to this interface.
