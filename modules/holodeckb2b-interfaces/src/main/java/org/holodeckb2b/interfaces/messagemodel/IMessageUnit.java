/**
 * Is a general representation for all types of ebMS message units and defines methods to access the information
 * available to all ebMS message units. This is the information contained in the <code>eb:MessageInfo</code> and child
 * elements of the ebMS messaging header. See ebMS Core specification, section 5 for more information on the message
 * model. Extension of this base interface define how information specific for a type of message unit can be accessed.
 * <p>This interface and its "<i>subclasses</i>" are used in Holodeck B2B to define the interfaces between the core 
 * modules and the external <i>business</i> applications. This decoupling allows for more easy extension of both the core 
 * as the external functionality.
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> The information that is available at  depends on the context of processing! If for example a user 
 * message is submitted to Holodeck B2B as a response of a Two-Way MEP, only the <i>RefToMessageId</i> might be known.
