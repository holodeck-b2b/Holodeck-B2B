/**
 * Represents the configuration of a trading partner involved in the message exchange. Extends the general {@link 
 * ITradingPartner} interface with the security configuration that should be used when exchanging messages with this
 * trading partner.
 * <p>In the ebMS specification the security parameters are defined on the leg level (or maybe even finer grained per 
 * message, but that is not really clear). Within Holodeck B2B we assume however that security settings are determined 
 * by the trading partners involved in the message exchange. Therefor the security configuration is part of the trading
 * partner configuration in the P-Mode. 
 * <p>As it however should be possible to specify the <i>PartyId</i>s to use in the message unit on submission the 
 * trading partner configuration in the P-Mode can exist of only the security configuration. 
 * <p>The security configuration contains the settings that are specific to this trading partner; the settings related 
 * to signing define how this trading partner will sign it messages, and the encryption settings define how messages to
 * this trading partner must be encrypted.<br>
 * This means that the security configuration of trading partner for which Holodeck B2B is the MSH contains the 
 * <b>private keys</b> and that the security configuration for the other partner contains the <b>public keys</b>.
