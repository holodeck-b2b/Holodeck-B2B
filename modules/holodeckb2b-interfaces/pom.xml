    <description>
        This module contains all the interfaces that are needed to build custom extension to add functionality to the 
        standard Holodeck B2B implementation. 
        NOTE: The license used for this module differs from the other modules that are part of the main Holodeck B2B
        project as this module is licensed under the Lesser GPL v3 license. The reason for the different licensing is
        to make clear that you develop closed source custom extension for Holodeck B2B as long as you only use the 
        interfaces as provided in this module.
