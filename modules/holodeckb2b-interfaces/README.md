#Holodeck B2B Interfaces

This module contains all the interfaces that are needed to build custom extension to add functionality to the standard 
Holodeck B2B implementation. 

**NOTE**: The license used for this module differs from the other modules that are part of the main Holodeck B2B
project as this module is licensed under the Lesser GPL v3 licence. 
The reason for the different licensing is to make clear that you *can* develop closed source custom extensions for Holodeck B2B as long as you only use the interfaces as provided in this module.
