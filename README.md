#Holodeck B2B
Holodeck B2B is a standalone B2B messaging solution that implements the OASIS specifications for ebMS3 and the AS4 profile. Java based, it will run on most platforms. 

It is designed with extensibility in mind providing an interface layer (API) which you can find in the Interfaces module, and lots of documentation inside the code.
